# python-chess-game
This is a simple chess python program for the chess lovers.
To play in their free time just like me.
I am a chess lover and its sometimes had to find a person to play with.
And its some times hard to find a person to challenge me 😅😅😅.
Hence i found a way of making the game as difficult as possible. 
With the best choice of outs comes using instructions rather than Artifical  Intelligence.
Hope you enjoy it.
